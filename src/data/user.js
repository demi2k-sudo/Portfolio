		title: "Gen AI Enthusiast and a Cloud Practitioner",
		description:
			"As a Gen AI Enthusiast, I thrive at the intersection of language models and cutting-edge cloud platforms. My expertise lies in orchestrating complex LLM architectures, expertly guiding their development and optimizing their performance. Leveraging my in-depth understanding of various LLM capabilities, I can tailor them to solve diverse problems across domains, seamlessly integrating them into cloud environments.\nMy proficiency extends to both Azure and AWS, solidified by rigorous international certifications in each platform. This dual mastery empowers me to navigate their ecosystems with ease, architecting robust solutions that leverage the strengths of each. Whether it's harnessing Azure's Cognitive Services or harnessing AWS's deep learning tools, I can navigate their intricacies to achieve optimal results. Beyond technical prowess, I possess a deep fascination with the evolution of LLMs and their potential to revolutionize various industries. This fuels my dedication to continuous learning and exploration, keeping me abreast of the latest advancements in the field. I am a highly collaborative individual, passionate about driving innovation through effective communication and teamwork.",

			"I am a passionate and curious individual with a strong interest in technology. I have always been fascinated by how things work, and I love learning new things. I am currently pursuing a career in machine learning, and I am excited about the endless possibilities that this field offers. \nIt was two years back when I started following Andrew NG from the university of Stanford. I loved his ideas and perceptions about data which inspired me a lot to continue pursuing my quest in understanding data. \nI am a confident and outgoing individual with a strong leadership presence. I am also a team player and I am good at working with others. I have experience managing people in my community and I love public speaking. \nI have work experience as a remote Data Science Intern at Oasis Infobyte and an onsite Data Science Inplant Training at ISRO Propulsion Complex. I have good knowledge on using ML libraries in Python and Matlab. I am also proficient in using SQL and other data analysis tools. I am a lifelong learner and I am always looking for new challenges. I am excited to contribute to the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence and to make a positive impact on the world.\nI've worked on a variety of projects over the years and I'm proud of the progress I've made. I may not have much professional experience as a Student but I'm pushing myself to use the best I've got. I'm a self learner and I always love to find new technologies to learn from. As an MLSA I've been given the wonderful opportunity to utilize resources in Azure which helped me a lot to create fine projects. You can check my github and feel free to contact me anytime!",

			title: "Cricket Highlight Generator",
			description:
				"Cricket Match Highlight Generator automates the process of generating highlights from full-length cricket matches. By leveraging Whisper models for audio transcription, the API extracts audio from videos and transcribes it with timestamps. Then it identifies significant moments using a Large Language Model (LLM), segments the match into clips, and merges them into a highlight video. This streamlined solution enhances viewer experience by providing a concise summary of key moments, catering to both casual viewers and avid fans.",

				"This Model is trained based on the transformer architecture from scratch in pytorch. A decoder only version of the Transformer model is used as to generate lyrics (make the language model dream data) that is similar to the lyrics provided to the model. I don't have enough resources and hence have provided the context window size of 8 characters. The output was kinda okayish but not great due to limited data and resources.",
